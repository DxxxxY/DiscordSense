# DiscordSense
**renamed from gamesense-discord-theme-2021**

Updated version of an old gamesense discord theme. Also has message slide-in animation that you can remove at the end of the code.
> Note: Some of the parts might not be themed because Discord likes to change their component's names quite often.
